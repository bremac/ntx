The Brief Guide to Porting ntx:

The notetags-extended utility was written mainly to the ANSI C99 standard,
however, some required operations are operating environment independent.
These functionalities have been separated from the main utility into small
wrapper source files: Two examples can be found in the source directory,
named 'src/unix.c' and 'src/win32.c' respectively.

This program makes very few assumptions about the underlying system in the
core code itself; Almost all of the implicit assumptions hold true for all
modern or recent operating systems. It assumes, of course, a C compiler
which supports the required subset of ANSI C99, and ANSI-compliant manual
memory management via the malloc() function. In addition, the zlib library
is assumed to be available on the target system, and either directory
hierarchies are supported, separated by the '/' character, or that the '/'
character is valid in file names, and directories can be spoofed in the
wrapper.

The source file for a new wrapper must suitably define only six functions
to be used by the ntx core. Their prototypes and descriptions follow:

  /* Function to create or edit a given file. */
  void ntx_editor(char *file);

  /* Function to create the home directory for ntx, change to it, and *
   * create a subdirectory for each supplied argument if necessary.   */
  void ntx_homedir(char *sub, ...);

  /* Get the length in bytes of a given file. As it is only used for  *
   * a best-guess heuristic sort of the files for the list mode, it   *
   * can simply return an arbitrary value if absolutely necessary.    */
  long int ntx_flen(char *file);

  /* Open a directory for listing, and return a handle to the caller. *
   * Returns NULL if something went wrong.                            */
  void *ntx_dopen(char *dir);

  /* Return the next file name as a string given an open directory    *
   * handle. Returns NULL if no further entries may be accessed.      */
  char *ntx_dread(void *dir);

  /* Close a given directory handle, and clean up after it. Returns   *
   * non-zero if there was some sort of failure or error.             */
  int ntx_dclose(void *dir);

No further declarations, definitions, macros, or even headers are required
beyond the single wrapper source file. Unfortunately, ntx is currently quite
tightly bound to the command line via assumption of output to stdout and
input as parameters, so it may not integrate quite so well into non-POSIX
operating environments in its present form; Patches are welcome to correct
this deficiency.
